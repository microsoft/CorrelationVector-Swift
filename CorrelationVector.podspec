  CorrelationVector library provides the Swift implementation of the CorrelationVector protocol for tracing and correlation of events through a distributed system. Correlation Vector (a.k.a. cV) is a format and protocol standard for tracing and correlation of events through a distributed system based on a light weight vector clock. The standard is widely used internally at Microsoft for first party applications and services and supported across multiple logging libraries and platforms (Services, Clients - Native, Managed, JS, iOS, Android etc). The standard powers a variety of different data processing needs ranging from distributed tracing & debugging to system and business intelligence, in various business organizations.
